Doc notes:

The .sprt file format is a human-readable file format for PBR materials, designed for use with animated pixel art.
The file format contains the path to several images, which themselves contain each frame of the animation.
The file format allows modifiers to be postfixed to the texture type to allow for various modifiers (such as filtering options) to be applied

A .sprt file looks like this:
<number of frames> <animation length>
<texture type><modifiers> <texture path>
<texture type><modifiers> <texture path>
.
.
.
<texture type><modifiers> <texture path>

All textures are assumed to contain <number of frames> frames, unless the '~' modifier is applied to mark the image as static

Texture properties can be modified by appending certain special characters to the beginning of the texture path name.
Special characetr glossary:

'~' - This texture should be treated as a single frame, which remains constant throughout the animation
'?' - This texture should be treated as sRGB
'!' - This texture should have a bilinear upscale filter (as opposed to nearest neighbour). On thickness map, used to detirmine texture coordinate fudge (Set the same as the most visible textures)

All texture paths are be assumed to be on the same animation cycle, with identical animation length and number of frames
if an image should remain static throughout the animation, prefix its texture path with a '~'. This will flag the texture
loader to treat the entire image as a single frame.
